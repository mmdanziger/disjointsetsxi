# disjointsetsxi
New algorithm to calculate the percolation correlation length of a lattice or spatial network based on disjoint sets.  
It is a growing algorithm based on disjoint sets that uses the parallel axis theorem to track the correlation length as nodes/links are added.

If you use the algorithm, please cite the forthcoming arXiv/paper:
